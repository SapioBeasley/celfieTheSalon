	Also, here is what we want under the "celfish beauty" tab for our lotions and such. We want "beauty kitchen junkie" to be underlined with a link to her website.

	"Celfish Beauty
	Celfie The Salon and Beauty Kitchen Junkie have teamed up to bring you a line of vegan, essential oil based products to spoil your bod with... We have created 15 signature scents that indulge your senses, and elevate your persona; Keeping you hydrated, smelling and feeling so fresh and so clean clean <3 "

	We were thinking of having it to where the 15 scent names are listed with their descriptions, and when you click on them a little window pops up with a drop down list of what we sell as well as a lil picture of the product.
	Something like that.
